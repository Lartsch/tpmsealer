# tpmsealer
Scripts for sealing / unsealing files using TPM with PCR policies. Can be used for understanding the basics.  

Provided as-is. Was used with a simulated TPM environment. Not sure if it works with an actual device (likely with some adjustments).  
Adjust the PREFIX variable if your environment has different tool names.  

Additional notes shown when using the -h flag.
